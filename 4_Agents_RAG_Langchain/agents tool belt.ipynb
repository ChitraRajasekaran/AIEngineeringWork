    "# Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "# LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "# Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "# In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "# Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

    "\n",
    "#     Automatic Tool Selection Based on Input Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "#     The system (often a language model or an agent framework) parses the user’s input and determines which tool is most relevant based on the context, keywords, or the specific nature of the query.\n",
    "#     For example, if the user’s input involves searching for general information on the web, the system might recognize that and select DuckDuckGoSearchRun.\n",
    "#     If the input is related to searching academic papers or scientific literature, it might select ArxivQueryRun.\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Explicit Tool Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "#     In some implementations, the developer might explicitly define when to use a particular tool based on conditions or user inputs. This might be done through conditional logic in the code.\n",
    "#     For instance, if the input contains the term “arXiv” or something indicative of academic research, the code might route the query to ArxivQueryRun. Otherwise, it might default to DuckDuckGoSearchRun.\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Decision-Making Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "#     There might be decision-making logic that ranks tools based on their relevance to the query or scores them according to how well they match the user’s needs. The tool with the highest score is then selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's some example selection logic:\n",

    "# def select_tool(user_input, tool_belt):\n",
    "#     if \"arxiv\" in user_input.lower():\n",

    "\n",
    "# selected_tool = select_tool(user_query, tool_belt)\n",
    "# selected_tool.run(user_query)\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

The paper introduces several innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance, such as 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), double quantization, and paged optimizers. The best model family, Guanaco, outperforms previous models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of ChatGPT\\'s performance level with only 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU.

    "# \"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, conversational agents, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.\"\n",
